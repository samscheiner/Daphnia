# Daphnia
These are the data files and publications associated with my Daphnia experiments. They are associated with the following publications:

Scheiner, S. M. and L. Yu.Yampolsky. 1998. Evolution of Daphnia pulex in a temporally varying environment. Genetical Research 72:25-37.
     This is a selection experiment on plasticity in Daphnia in response to temporal variation in temperature.

Scheiner, S. M. and D. Berrigan. 1998. The genetics of phenotypic plasticity. VIII. The cost of plasticity in Daphnia pulex. Evolution 52:368-378.
     This is an experiment measuring the cost of plasticity. The data on metabolic rate are missing.
